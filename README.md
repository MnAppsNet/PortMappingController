# PortMappingController
This is a small wep app that can create and delete port mappings on your router using UPNP.
Your router must support UPNP for this to work.

# How to install
Just CD into the client directory and build the react app with 'npm run build'.
Then execute the python script and navigate to http://localhost:5050 (you can also access the panel from other devices in the network by specifying the ip address of the machine that runs the script).
